TODO:
* Games
* Music -> Kosbie wants this to use location
* Canvas -> Kosbie wants us to make a sort of a collage from all the things we've added to the calendar
* Calendar -> ability to add things to your calendar. we should definitely try to do so you can download that calendar but im not too worried about actually visualizing it if we do the canvas thing, we might not have to have an actual calendar looking thing
* Some css styling issues -> right now code does not work with css reset. I'm going to fix this. 
* CLEAN UP CODE ACCORDING TO STYLE GUIDELINES
* Animation/transitions -> one idea i have is to also keep track of the synopsis of the item then if they hover over that entry, the area will get taller and also display synopsis using transitions.

If we had more time:
* have a pool of keywords for each entry so that if the person says they like animations for example, we will give a list of animations
* have a page for each entry hat can give more information
