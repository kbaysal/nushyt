Hey guys, sorry i messed up branching/merging/conflict issue a little but i believe i was able to put everything back to normal. 
We now have all of our tabs working as semi-expected :) There are a few issues but I'm gonna fix (fingers crossed) them tomorrow. 


TODO:
* Put everything into one page. (I got this-Kiraz)
* Music -> Kosbie wants this to use location (Darren you're still waiting from Soundkick? There are other APIs out there if they dont get back to us by tomorrow)
* Canvas -> Kosbie wants us to make a sort of a collage from all the things we've added to the calendar (Ted how is this going?)
* Calendar -> ability to add things to your calendar. we should definitely try to do so you can download that calendar but im not too worried about actually visualizing it if we do the canvas thing, we might not have to have an actual calendar looking thing
* Some css styling issues -> right now code does not work with css reset. I'm going to fix this. 
* Style
* Animation/transitions -> WE NEED IDEAS!

If we had more time:
* have a pool of keywords for each entry so that if the person says they like animations for example, we will give a list of animations
* have a page for each entry that can give more information

Actual readme stuff:
