Right now the way we do personal results is by giving your query to TasteKid, and comparing all the similar results it gives back to us to the entries we alrady have in the list. If there is a much it displays that on top.\r\nSome more examples: \"halo 4\" for games, \"red\" for albums, \"arrow\" for tv shows... however, these don't return related results as there is nothing related in our list using the \"related\" definition of TasteKid.\r\nIf we had more time, we would create a list of words for each movie/game.... from the genre, cast/crew... and compare those as well. \r\n\r\nIn order to have calendar stuff working follow these steps: \r\n1. navigate to the project folder in the terminal/cmd\r\n2. run this command:\r\n\tpython -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000\r\n3. keep the terminal window open throughout using the application\r\n4. access the website by going to http://localhost:8000\r\n\r\nAPIs used:\r\n1)Taste kid\r\n2)Rotten Tomatoes\r\n3)Rovi\r\n4)LastFM\r\n5)Yahoo YQL\r\n6)Google Calendar\r\n7)Songkick\r\n\r\nWebpages scraped using YQL:\r\n1)metacritic.com\r\n2)gamefly.com\r\n\r\nThings we're using that we learned in class: \r\nCanvas: We made a banner out of canvas that adds an image of the things you added to your calendar.\r\nSkeleton: We made our site responsive by using skeleton and adding more to it.\r\nAjax calls: We make Ajax calls to 9 different API/websites.\r\nTransitions: We used transitions to animate our help button.\r\nCSS: lots of fun things like pseudo elements for hover.\r\nDOM manipulation: one example is that each time you click on a tab we don't make a second request we just change what's being shown.\r\nForms: search bar\r\nLocation: we use navigator (HTML5) to get the location of the user and use it to find music events close by.\r\n\r\n\r\n","name":"Nushyt"}
